- **Customizable Output**: Easily specify where the compressed files should be saved.
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Stay informed with a progress bar and status updates while compression is in progress.
- **Instant Notifications**: Get notified when compression is complete.
- **Lossless Compression**: Ensure your files retain their original quality and data integrity.

### üóÇÔ∏è File Decompression
- **Easy Decompression**: Select GZip-compressed files and restore them to their original state with just a few clicks.
- **Custom Output Location**: Specify where the decompressed files should be stored.
- **Visual Feedback**: Keep track of the decompression progress with a dynamic progress bar.

### üñ•Ô∏è Enhanced User Interface (UI)
- **Responsive Design**: A clean, modern layout that adjusts smoothly to different file operations.
- **Interactive Buttons & File Dialogs**: Simple and intuitive buttons and dialogs for selecting files and folders.
- **Detailed Status Messages**: Users receive helpful status messages, ensuring they know exactly what's happening at every step.
